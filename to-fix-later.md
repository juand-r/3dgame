```gdscript
func _on_host_server_button_pressed():
    """Handle host server button press"""
    _play_button_click()
    GameEvents.log_info("UI: Host Server button pressed")
    # TODO: Implement host server functionality
```

### 2. **Graphics Quality Settings**
**Location:** `Scripts/UI/MainUI.gd:517`
**Issue:** Graphics quality dropdown shows options but doesn't actually change anything
**TODO:** Implement actual graphics quality changes

```gdscript
func _on_quality_selected(index: int):
    """Handle graphics quality selection"""
    var quality_options = ["Low", "Medium", "High", "Ultra"]
    var selected_quality = quality_options[index]
    GameEvents.log_info("Graphics quality changed to: %s" % selected_quality)
    _save_graphics_setting("quality", selected_quality)
    # TODO: Implement actual quality changes
```

**Requirements:**
- Define quality presets (Low/Medium/High/Ultra)

- Apply changes immediately without restart
- Persist quality setting across sessions
