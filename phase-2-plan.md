#### **Technical Implementation:**

**In PlayerController.gd:**
```gdscript
# Add to PlayerController.gd
var last_sent_position: Vector3
var last_sent_rotation: Vector3
var position_send_threshold: float = 0.1  # Only send if moved this much

func sync_position_to_network():
    if not is_local_player:
        return
        
    # Only send if position changed significantly
    if global_position.distance_to(last_sent_position) < position_send_threshold:
        return
        
    var position_data = {
        "type": "player_position",
        "player_id": player_id,
        "position": {
            "x": global_position.x,
            "y": global_position.y, 
            "z": global_position.z
        },
        "rotation": {
            "x": rotation.x,
            "y": rotation.y,
            "z": rotation.z
        },
        "velocity": {
            "x": velocity.x,
            "y": velocity.y,
            "z": velocity.z
        },
        "timestamp": Time.get_ticks_msec(),
        "is_grounded": is_on_floor()
    }
    
    NetworkManager.send_data(position_data)
    last_sent_position = global_position
    last_sent_rotation = rotation
```

**In GameManager.gd:**
```gdscript
# Add to existing _on_network_data_received method
func _on_network_data_received(from_id: int, data: Dictionary):
    var message_type = data.get("type", "")
    
    match message_type:
        "player_position":
            handle_player_position_update(from_id, data)
        "player_count_update":
            # Existing logic...
        _:
            GameEvents.log_debug("Unknown message type: %s" % message_type)

func handle_player_position_update(from_id: int, data: Dictionary):
    # Find or create remote player
    var remote_player = get_or_create_remote_player(from_id, data)
    
    # Apply position update
    remote_player.apply_network_position_update(data)

func get_or_create_remote_player(player_id: int, data: Dictionary) -> Player:
    # Check if player already exists
    if player_id in remote_players:
        return remote_players[player_id]
    
    # Create new remote player
    var player_scene = preload("res://Scenes/Player/Player.tscn")
    var new_player = player_scene.instantiate()
    new_player.player_id = player_id
    new_player.is_local_player = false
    new_player.player_name = "Player%d" % player_id
    
    # Add to world
    current_world.add_child(new_player)
    remote_players[player_id] = new_player
    
    GameEvents.log_info("Created remote player: %d" % player_id)
    return new_player
```

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Position Sync**: Remote player positions update in real-time
- [ ] **Smooth Movement**: No jittering or stuttering for remote players
- [ ] **Responsive Local**: Local player movement feels instant
- [ ] **Multi-Player**: 2+ players can move simultaneously 
- [ ] **Performance**: No FPS drops below 30fps

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing (Per Feature):**
1. **Single Player Test**: Test movement in isolation
2. **Local Networking Test**: Test position broadcasting  
3. **Remote Player Test**: Test position receiving/applying
4. **Multi-Instance Test**: Test with 2 Godot instances

### **Integration Testing:**
**Test Scenario 1: Basic Movement**
```
Instance 1 (Server):
  1. Start server (F1)
  2. Should spawn as local player
  3. Test WASD movement works
  4. Test camera mouse look works
  5. Test jump works

Instance 2 (Client):  
  1. Connect to server (F2)
  2. Should spawn as local player
  3. Test same movement functionality
  4. Should see Instance 1's player moving
```

**Test Scenario 2: Real-time Sync**
```
Both Instances:
  1. Move players in different directions
  2. Verify both see each other moving
  3. Test simultaneous movement
  4. Test rapid direction changes
  5. Verify no position lag/jitter
```

**Test Scenario 3: Connection Stability**
```
Multi-Instance Test:
  1. Start with 2 players moving
  2. Disconnect one player
  3. Reconnect player
  4. Verify clean state recovery
  5. Test with 3-4 players if possible
```

### **Performance Testing:**
- **FPS Monitoring**: Should maintain 60fps target
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks
- **Network Usage**: Log bytes sent/received
- **Latency**: Measure position update delay

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Approach**

### **Development Strategy:**
1. **Build Incrementally**: Get basic movement working first
2. **Test Early**: Test each feature before moving to next
3. **Local First**: Perfect single-player before adding networking  
4. **Simple Then Complex**: Basic sync before optimization
5. **Multi-Instance**: Test networking with real Godot instances

### **Risk Mitigation:**
**High Risk: Network Synchronization Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple position broadcasting
- **Fallback**: Use basic interpolation if prediction is too complex

**Medium Risk: Performance with Multiple Players**
- **Mitigation**: Monitor FPS during development
- **Fallback**: Reduce position update frequency if needed

**Low Risk: Camera/Movement Feel**
- **Mitigation**: Use proven FPS/third-person camera patterns
- **Fallback**: Copy camera logic from successful Godot tutorials

### **Dependencies & Blockers:**
**No Major Dependencies**: Foundation phase provides everything needed
**Potential Blockers**: None identified - all tools and systems ready
