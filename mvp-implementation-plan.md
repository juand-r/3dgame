## 📊 **Daily Milestones & Reviews**

### **Daily Standup Structure (15 minutes)**
1. **What did you complete yesterday?**
2. **What are you working on today?**
3. **Any blockers or dependencies?**
4. **Integration points with other team members?**

### **Key Integration Points**
- **Day 2 EOD**: Network foundation ready for testing
- **Day 4 EOD**: Basic multiplayer movement working
- **Day 6 EOD**: Vehicle system integrated
- **Day 8 EOD**: Complete local experience ready
- **Day 10 EOD**: MVP deployed and tested

### **Risk Mitigation**
**High Risk Items:**
1. **WebSocket connectivity issues** 
   - Mitigation: Test early, have fallback to local multiplayer
2. **Railway deployment problems**
   - Mitigation: Set up deployment pipeline early
3. **Physics synchronization complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple sync, optimize later

**Backup Plans:**
- If Railway fails → Use local networking for MVP demo
- If vehicle physics too complex → Use kinematic movement temporarily
- If 4-player performance poor → Reduce to 2-player MVP
